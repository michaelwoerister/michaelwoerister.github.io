# rust-gdb. rust-lldb.
Unbeknownst to most Rustaceans, two little helpers have found their way into 
almost any Rust installation over the last few months: `rust-gdb` and 
`rust-lldb`. These are two small wrapper scripts that will start the underlying
debugger with Rust **pretty printers** enabled. The pretty printers are
Python-based extensions that hook into the debuggers output rendering, hopefully
making it easier to inspect your Rust program's runtime state. This post will
describe what `rust-gdb` and `rust-lldb` can do for you, what their limits are,
and how to use them (hint: *it's easy!*)



## What To Expect
The probably biggest advantage of using the pretty printers is the **improved
rendering of enum values**. Enums have a slightly convoluted debuginfo encoding
that allows  C-oriented debuggers to make sense of them even though they don't 
know about Rust. The default rendering of a value with this encoding is rather 
unreadable though. 

For example, a "regular" enum value like `Ok(true)` of type `Result<bool, u64>` 
will look as follows in the debugger:

```rust
GDB: result = { {RUST$ENUM$DISR = Ok, true}, {RUST$ENUM$DISR = Ok, 0} }
LLDB: (core::result::Result<bool, u64>) result = {
          = (RUST$ENUM$DISR = Ok, true)
          = (RUST$ENUM$DISR = Ok, 0)
      }
```

A "space-optimized" enum value like `Some(&123)` of type `Option<&u32>` will be
even less decipherable:

```rust
GDB: {RUST$ENCODED$ENUM$0$None = {0x7fffffffdafc}}
LLDB: (core::option::Option<&u32>) option = {
          RUST$ENCODED$ENUM$0$None = {
              = 0x7fffffffdafc
          }
      }
```

The pretty printers rectify this situation, filtering out the discriminant and
the wrong interpretations of the enum value. For the above examples you will 
get:

```rust
GDB:  result = Ok = {true}
      option = Some = {0x7fffffffdafc}

LLDB: (core::result::Result<bool, u64>) result = Ok(true)
      (core::option::Option<&u32>) option = Some(&0x7fffffffdafc)
```

Some other niceties that the pretty printers bring, are:

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Readable</strong> rendering of <code>&str</code> and <code>std::String</code> values:
{% highlight rust %}
Rust:  let str_slice = "IAMA string slice!";
GDB:   str_slice = "IAMA string slice!"
LLDB:  (not yet implemented)

Rust:  let string = "IAMA string!".to_string();
GDB:   string = "IAMA string!"
LLDB:  (not yet implemented)
{% endhighlight %}
  </li>

  <li>
<strong>Readable</strong> rendering of <strong>slices</strong> and <code>std::Vec</code> values:
{% highlight rust %}
Rust:  let slice: &[i32] = &[0, 1, 2, 3];
GDB:   slice = &[i32](len: 4) = {0, 1, 2, 3}
LLDB:  (&[i32]) slice = &[0, 1, 2, 3]

Rust:  let vec = vec![4, 5, 6, 7];
GDB:   vec = Vec<u64>(len: 4, cap: 4) = {4, 5, 6, 7}
LLDB:  (collections::vec::Vec<u64>) vec = vec![4, 5, 6, 7]
{% endhighlight %}
  </li>
</ul>

One thing to note about these pretty printers is that in principle they can also
be enabled when the debugger is used through a UI front-end, such as XCode or
[RustDT](//rustdt.github.io/). For the latter I have already tried this:

However, this isn't yet supported out-of-the-box for any debugger front-end and
enabling pretty printers can be a bit cumbersome. The brave 
and fearless can take a look at the `rust-gdb` and `rust-lldb` scripts and try
to make their favorite debugger front-end start the debugger process with these
settings added.


## What Not To Expect
While these pretty printers definitely improve the debugging experience for Rust
programs, there are limits to what can be done in terms of language support 
short of actually going into the debuggers' core codebase and making the 
language a first-class citizen.

The most prominent thing that **cannot be implemented** by mere 
Python-extensions is **expression parsing and evaluation**. As a consequence,
when debugging a Rust program, the debugger will basically treat the program as
if it were actually written in C/C++.

Some of the things in Rust are similar enough to C that you can use them
just the same, such as arithmetic expressions over primitives, e.g. `2 + 4 * 5`,
or directly accessing the fields of a struct.

However, many other things work differently under the hood in Rust than in C and
the debugger will balk at your trying to use these constructs, among them such 
fundamental things as accessing elements in a slice, accessing fields of an enum
or tuple, anything that uses auto-dereferencing, or calling Rust-defined
methods, functions, or closures.

If the you know the internal representation of things you can do some funky 
stuff like using C pointer arithmetic to access elements in a slice:

```C
print slice.data_ptr[3]
```

In general, however, the situation in this respect is most unsatisfactory. In 
order to support these crucial features, someone will have to go and directly
extend the LLDB and GDB codebases. But back to the good news of this post.

## Usage
`rust-gdb` and `rust-lldb` are just small shell scripts that inject some 
additional commandline arguments into the invocation of the underlying debugger.
These additional arguments make sure that the proper pretty printers are loaded
before anything else is done. The rest of the commandline arguments given to the
`rust-gdb`/`rust-lldb` scripts are passed along unmodified to the underlying
debugger. In other words, you should be able to use the scripts exactly like you
would use the respective debugger.

Here are some common examples:

<ul>
<li>
Starting a Rust executable without any arguments:

{% highlight c %}
rust-gdb ./your-program
rust-lldb ./your-program
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
Starting a Rust executable with additional arguments to the debugger:

{% highlight c %}
rust-gdb -statistics ./your-program
rust-lldb --no-use-colors ./your-program
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
Starting a Rust executable with arguments to the debugger and arguments to the executable being debugged:

{% highlight c %}
rust-gdb -statistics --args ./your-program --prog-arg1 --prog-arg2
rust-lldb --no-use-colors  --  ./your-program --prog-arg1 --prog-arg2
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
</ul>

Note that the `rust-gdb`/`rust-lldb` scripts will always use the debugger in 
your `PATH`, e.g. `rust-gdb` internally just calls `gdb` without any
qualifications. The scripts also assume that there is a valid `rustc` in your
`PATH`, which they use to find the pretty printer plugins.

If you have installed Rust (e.g. via the nightly-installer or 
[rustup.sh](//github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/rustup.sh)) you
should be good to go out-of-the-box, since the installer will have put 
`rust-gdb` (on Linux) or `rust-lldb` (on Mac OS X) right next to your `rustc`
and `cargo` executables.

On **Windows** `rust-gdb` is **not installed** by default because GDB has 
sometimes been rather unstable on this platform. You can still give it a try by
running the `rust-gdb` script file found in `src/etc/` in a MinGW shell.

Since pretty printer plugins are implemented in terms of the debuggers' Python
APIs, and these have changed over time, the **minimum supported** debugger versions
are **GDB 7.7** and **LLDB 310**. However, the general rule is: the newer the 
better.

If you are using a moderately recent Linux or Mac OS X version, and have an
up-to-date Rust installation, chances are good that everything will just work,
i.e. that you can use `rust-gdb`/`rust-lldb` from the commandline just as you
would use GDB or LLDB.

## Closing Words
Over the coming months there will hopefully be a few minor feature additions,
like pretty printers for more standard library types and 
[frame decorators](//sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Frame-Decorator-API.html). 
As always, if you encounter any bugs, please open an issue on 
[Github](//github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues).
