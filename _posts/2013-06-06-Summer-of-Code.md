#Summer of Code 2013 w/ Mozilla and Rust
You probably began to feel it too last week, the changing of little things: 
The food tasting delicious, an unexpected smile on your lips, 
beautiful people everywhere you look.  
The tune of the world finally spinning into harmony, if you will. And the spring
in your step it has not subsided since. Maybe you don't know where it is 
coming from, this assurance that this summer is going to be good, to be great
even---so let me tell you.

Yes, it is true, I have been accepted to this year's 
[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013)
and I will be working on debug symbol generation for [Mozilla's](http://www.mozilla.org/) [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). 
There it is---you finally know where this exuberance of yours has been coming 
from all of a sudden. 

It's OK to embrace it now, really.  
I do too.
